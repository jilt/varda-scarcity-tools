# Varda Scarcity tools 
Built to allow floor price control for large NFT collections through DeFi Farming mechanics.
These tools make large usage of [Open-Rpc Near Client Generator](generator) and the [Open RPC Near Token Standards](https://github.com/swappland/open-rpc-near-token-standards). Refer to the
OpenRPC specification and the JSON schema specification to get started.

## Usage

### Installation 
```
npm install @swappland/market-contract-client
```

```ts
import SwapplandClient from "@swappland/market-contract-client"

const testnetContractId ="mkt.landofswapps.testnet"
const mainnetContractid = "mkt.swappland.near"

// Setup Purely for example
const accountId: string = "some_account_you_have_in_credentials.near"
const keystore = new keyStores.UnencryptedFileSystemKeyStore(`${os.homedir()}/.near-credentials`)
const near = new Near({
    networkId: "testnet",
    nodeUrl: "https://rpc.testnet.near.org",
    walletUrl: "https://wallet.testnet.near.org",
    explorerUrl: "https://explorer.testnet.near.org", 
    deps: {keyStore}, headers:{}})

// The only thing the client really needs  followed by the contractId
const account:Account = await near.account(accountId);

const client = new SwapplandClient({account, contractId: testnetContractId})

```

### Build 
```
npm install
npm run build
```

### Early days note.
It's early days and the interface is still subject to change depending on usecases that come up. 
A few methods still need to be deprecated around the adminstration of the contract here's a that was 
easy link to the [spec][market-spec](beware some non essential methods are now deprecated, but are pending removal from spec).
